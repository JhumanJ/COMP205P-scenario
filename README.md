# COMP205P-scenario: Awakening robots

NP-Hard problem for a UCL scenario Week.
The described challenge is a combination of a well-known Robot Motion Planning problem (RMP) and less well-known Freeze-Tag problem (FT). In RMP, one should find an optimal way for a robot from a point A to a point B in the presence of multiple obstacles. In FT, a swarm of robots must wake up in the shortest possible time, starting from one specified robots.

This problem was solved using Python and severals of its libraries. Team member were Romain Dumon, Kristelle Feghali and myself.
